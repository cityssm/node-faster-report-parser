**Parses select Excel (XLSX) and CSV reports from the
[FASTER Web](https://fasterasset.com/products/fleet-management-software/) Fleet Management System
into usable data objects.**

Useful when developing integrations between FASTER Web and other systems.

## Advanced Parsers

More than just parsing files into objects. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

`extractInventoryImportErrors(messageLoggerData)`

- Takes data from a parsed CSV "W603 - Message Logger" report,
  attempts to identify errors related to the Inventory Import Utility (IIU) integration,
  and provide context of where the errors occurred.

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è When parsing reports, use the files **as exported** from FASTER Web.<br />
Reports that are opened and resaved in Excel will lose formatting required by the parsers.

‚ö†Ô∏è Excel exports from search results and other tables are **not valid** Excel files.<br />
No parsers can be written for them!

## Installation

```sh
npm install @cityssm/faster-report-parser
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { parseW223ExcelReport } from '@cityssm/faster-report-parser/xlsx'

const parsedReport = parseW223ExcelReport('C:/path/to/report.xlsx')

console.log(parsedReport.data[0].storeroomDescription)
// => "MAIN STOREROOM"
```

## Integration Tips

üí° Schedule exporting the necessary reports in FASTER Web to an FTP, then download those reports for parsing.

- [basic-ftp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basic-ftp) does a great job downloading from FASTER Web FTP sites!

üí° Schedule downloading reports from the FTP based on the export schedule defined in FASTER Web.

- [node-schedule](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule) makes it easy to schedule downloading
  new reports using parameters very similar to the scheduling parameters in FASTER Web.

üí° Make use of other APIs and import tools to integrate with other systems.

- [@cityssm/dynamics-gp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cityssm/dynamics-gp) - Unofficial integrations with the Microsoft Dynamics GP financial system.

- [@cityssm/worktech-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cityssm/worktech-api) - Unofficial integrations with the WorkTech work order management system.
